# Project 1: Navigation

## Introduction

For this project, you will train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.  

![Trained Agent][image1]

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

2. Place the file in the DRLND GitHub repository, in the `p1_navigation/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file. 

## Python Environment

We advise using a Python 3.6 environment with all the libraries requierement described in the Github repository [udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning). In addition, to get nice and interactive (zoomable) curves, we used Bokeh and Holoview libraries.

## Running the code

Our project contains two Notebooks:
- **Navigation** : This Notebook contains:
    - the main routine (dqn) for the training of the agent,
    - the adjustments of the hyper parameters,
    - the display of the score of the trained agent (final and during training). 
- **Curves (hyper parameters setting and final results)**: this notebook plots:
    -  the results of the tuning of hyper parameters,
    - the final score.

Our code contains two Python modules :

- **dqn_agent.py** : This module contains the deep reinforcement learning agent.
- **model.py**: this module describes the PyTorch neural network. Note that contrary to the base implementation we derived, the number of layers and their size is parameterizable.


We choosed to separate the two notebooks because the second one contains additional dependencies (Holoviews and Bokeh) used to generate nice and interactive plots.
